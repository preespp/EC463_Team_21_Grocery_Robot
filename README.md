# Team_21_Grocery_Robot

Our groupâ€™s vision is to make everyday shopping more efficient and inclusive. We aim to address issues that would benefit both owners and customers through an intelligent, multi-functional robotic system to improve shelf management and customer experience. Our final delivery would be a multi-wheel robot with functional robotic arm(s), sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence to assist in employee stocking and customer shopping.
