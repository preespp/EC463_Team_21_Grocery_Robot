# Team 21 Grocery Robot
Our groupâ€™s vision is to make everyday shopping more efficient and inclusive. We aim to address issues that would benefit both owners and customers through an intelligent, multi-functional robotic system to improve shelf management and customer experience. Our final delivery would be a multi-wheel robot with functional robotic arm(s), sensors, cameras, and artificial intelligence to assist in employee stocking and customer shopping.

## Mission
To design and develop an intelligent, multi-functional robotic system that streamlines shelf management and enhances customer experience in a grocery store. Our mission is to integrate robotics, sensors, and artificial intelligence to assist employees in stocking tasks, ensure product availability, and provide customers with inclusive, efficient shopping support to make daily activities more convenient.

## Project Summary
In recent years, more and more robots are being employed in order to make daily life more convenient. These systems benefit the users by freeing up time and performing tasks that require precision. The Grocery Robot aims to build a robust robotic system that will perform a wide variety of assistive functions to make grocery shopping more accessible and convenient.

The robotic system will navigate through a grocery store to restock products and assist shoppers in collecting their wanted items. To operate the system, a web application will provide the robot with the location of goods. Grocery items will be classified using computer vision, and robotic arms will grab the product. Furthermore, the robot will accommodate various users. The robot will assist delivery drivers to save time and energy, and it will be able to assist customers with special needs who may have trouble shopping by themselves.
